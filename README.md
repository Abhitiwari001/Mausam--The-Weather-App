Mausam prides itself on the accuracy of its forecasts, and the global weather monitoring company's free mobile app manages to pack a lot into each screen. It's got everything from instant readings on what the weather's doing now, to more detailed Map scans showing precipitation and clouds over a wider area.


And it's not just for sunshine and rain: The app can give details on Wind Speed ,Humidity, Pressure,Sunrise,Sunset,UV Index, and more. 

It's undoubtedly one of the best weather apps out there for the depth and precision of its data.
